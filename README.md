# Desktop Cleaner

## Overview

**Desktop Cleaner** is a Python-based utility that monitors a designated download directory and automatically moves image files (such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.) to a specified folder, helping to keep your download folder clutter-free. It continuously runs in the background and moves image files as soon as they are detected.

## Features

- Moves image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, etc.) to a designated folder.
- Lightweight and simple to configure.
- Customizable download and destination directories.

- Python 3.x installed.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - `os`
  - `shutil`
  - `time`
  - `watchdog` (for monitoring the directory)

You can install `watchdog` via pip:
